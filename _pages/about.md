I currently work as an Associate at MPM BioImpact, a Boston-based biotechnology investment fund. 

Prior to this role, I completed my Ph.D. at MIT in [Computational and Systems Biology](https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb) under the supervision of [Professor Connor Coley](https://coley.mit.edu/), where I was also fortunate to be supported by the Takeda AI for Healthcare Fellowship. While I am broadly excited about AI/ML for molecular design, my academic work focused on computational methods to discover disease-relevant or bioactive metabolites from metabolomics data. I also explored the biotechnology industry through student-led groups: I was Co-President of the [MIT Biotechnology Group](https://biotech.mit.edu/) (MBG) and co-founded/managed a
student-led accelerator [Nucleate Eco](https://nucleate.xyz/activator/). 

Prior to MIT, I studied computer science at Harvard, wrote an undergraduate thesis in systems biology, was a Divsion I wrestler, and spent a brief stint as a summer investment fellow at
[Activant Capital](https://www.activantcapital.com/).

Outside of work, I enjoy running, ice cream, fantasy/sci-fi (audio)books, and following NCAA wrestling.
