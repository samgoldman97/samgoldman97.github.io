I am a currently a PhD Candidate in [Computational and Systems
Biology](https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb)
at MIT supported by the Takeda AI for Helathcare Fellowship. As [Professor
Connor Coley's](https://coley.mit.edu/) first graduate student, I broadly seek
to build AI-based technologies for molecular discovery and design.  I am now
especially interested in computational methods to find novel and
disease relevant metabolites from mass spectrometry-based metabolomics.

<!--During my senior year, I was also exposed to recent deep learning advances
in natural language processes and worked briefly with Professor Debora Marks to
apply these tools to RNA codon optimization. --> I am interested in
biotechnology entrepreneurship both for healthcare and the environment. I was
previously the Co-President of the [MIT Biotechnology
Group](https://biotech.mit.edu/) (MBG), MIT's premier connection to the biotech
ecosystem. During that same time, I co-founded and subsequently managed a
student-led, zero-equity  accelerator [Nucleate
Eco](https://nucleate.xyz/activator/) (FKA Activate Eco) for biotechnologies
specifically addressing sustainability challenges. 
<!--In my tenure, Nucleate Eco
enabled 15 new startups with technologies drawn from universities such as
Harvard, MIT, Tufts, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and the Salk Institute.-->

Prior to MIT, I studied computer science at Harvard and wrote a [senior
thesis](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37364604/GOLDMAN-SENIORTHESIS-2019.pdf?sequence=1)
in network simulations for systems biology under the mentorship of Professor
Philippe Cluzel. I also spent a brief stint as a summer investment fellow at
[Activant Capital](https://www.activantcapital.com/), where I helped dilligence 
agtech and supply chain investment opportunities.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, eating ice cream, and reading fiction. In a previous
life, I was an [NCAA Division I Wrestler at
Harvard](https://gocrimson.com/news/2019/6/27/6_27_2019_524) and still cheering for the Crimson.

I'm always happy to discuss new ideas, potential opportunites, and my thoughts
on the hopes (and false promises) of machine learning in biochemistry. You can
