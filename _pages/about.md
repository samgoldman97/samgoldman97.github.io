I am a PhD Candidate in [Computational and Systems Biology](https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb) at MIT, where I am advised by [Professor Connor Coley](https://coley.mit.edu/) and supported by the Takeda AI for Healthcare Fellowship. While I am broadly excited about AI/ML for molecular design, my PhD work has focused on computational methods to discover disease-relevant or bioactive metabolites from metabolomics data.

I am also interested in biotechnology entrepreneurship and investing, which I am exploring as a part-time fellow at
[MPM BioImpact](https://mpmcapital.com/). I was previously the Co-President of
the [MIT Biotechnology Group](https://biotech.mit.edu/) (MBG). During this time, I co-founded and
subsequently managed a student-led, zero-equity  accelerator [Nucleate
Eco](https://nucleate.xyz/activator/) (previously Activate Eco) for
biotechnologies specifically addressing sustainability challenges. 

Prior to MIT, I studied computer science at Harvard, wrote an undergraduate senior
thesis
in network simulations for systems biology, was a Divsion I wrestler, and spent a brief stint as a summer investment fellow at
[Activant Capital](https://www.activantcapital.com/).

Outside of work, I enjoy running, ice cream, fantasy/sci-fi (audio)books, and following NCAA wrestling. I can be reached at samlg [at] mit [dot] edu.
