I am currently a PhD Candidate in [Computational and Systems
Biology](https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb)
at MIT supported by the Takeda AI for Healthcare Fellowship. As [Professor
Connor Coley's](https://coley.mit.edu/) first graduate student, I broadly seek
to build AI-based technologies for molecular discovery and design.  I am now
especially interested in computational methods to find novel and
disease relevant metabolites from mass spectrometry-based metabolomics.

I am interested in biotechnology entrepreneurship and investing for both
healthcare and the environment, which I am exploring as a part-time fellow at
[MPM Capital](https://mpmcapital.com/). I was previously the Co-President of
the [MIT Biotechnology Group](https://biotech.mit.edu/) (MBG), MIT's premier
connection to the biotech ecosystem. During that same time, I co-founded and
subsequently managed a student-led, zero-equity  accelerator [Nucleate
Eco](https://nucleate.xyz/activator/) (previously Activate Eco) for
biotechnologies specifically addressing sustainability challenges. 

<!--In my tenure, Nucleate Eco
enabled 15 new startups with technologies drawn from universities such as
Harvard, MIT, Tufts, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and the Salk Institute.-->

Prior to MIT, I studied computer science at Harvard and wrote a [senior
thesis](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37364604/GOLDMAN-SENIORTHESIS-2019.pdf?sequence=1)
in network simulations for systems biology under the mentorship of Professor
Philippe Cluzel. I also spent a brief stint as a summer investment fellow at
[Activant Capital](https://www.activantcapital.com/), where I helped dilligence 
agtech and supply chain investment opportunities.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, eating ice cream, and reading fiction (fantasy/sci-fi). In a previous
life, I was an [NCAA Division I Wrestler at
Harvard](https://gocrimson.com/news/2019/6/27/6_27_2019_524) and still cheer for the Crimson.

I'm always happy to discuss new ideas, potential opportunites, and my thoughts
on the hopes (and misconceptions) of machine learning in biochemistry. You can
